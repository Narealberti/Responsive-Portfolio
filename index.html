<p> I was born on December 7th, 1989 in Armenia.
<p> I studied at Yerevan Medical college where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry. </p>
<p> I have 10 years of experience working in the medical field and continue to pursue a higher education.</p> 
<p> I am a self-motivated person who enjoys challenges and works well under pressure both as an individual and with others.</p> 
<p> My personality strengths are my persistence and determination to see that I complete a task that I've set forth to do regardless of the complications.</p>
<p> A weakness of mine would be my tendency of exhausting myself when setting on a course to complete my goals. </p>
